		<h2 class='dotted-indents'>About Me</h2>
		<p class='dotted-indents'>
			I don't think lorem ipsum is as cool as all the other ipsums that were inspired by it. Like cat
			ipsum or hipster ipsum. I wonder if there is a code ipsum that is just words related to
			programming and development. I should make one if there isn't one.

			My favorite food is ice cream. My favorite food is also pizza. And pasta. And cookies. My favorite flavors
			for all of those are, respectively: cookies and cream, hawaiian, carbonara, and white chocolate macadamia nut.
